## JPMorgan Chase Validation Services Integration

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the practical integration of the JPMorgan Chase Validation Services API into the curl project.

### Overview

The integration offers full support for account validation, entity validation, and payroll processing, enabling robust validation services within the curl ecosystem.

### Components

- **Core Validation Module (`lib/validation.c`)**
  - Account validation endpoint support
  - Entity validation endpoint support
  - Authentication header management
  - JSON payload creation
  - Response processing

- **Payroll Validation Module (`lib/validation_payroll.c`)**
  - Payroll-specific validation requests
  - Employer information handling
  - Payroll amount and currency validation
  - Transaction context support

- **JSON Processing (`lib/validation_json.c`)**
  - Complex JSON payload serialization
  - Response parsing utilities
  - String escaping for JSON safety

- **Public APIs**
  - `include/curl/validation.h` - Core validation API
  - `include/curl/validation_payroll.h` - Payroll validation API

- **Command-line Interface (`src/tool_validation.c`)**
  - New curl options for validation services
  - Direct command-line usage support

### Usage Examples

#### Account Validation

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-mock.payments.jpmorgan.com/tsapi/v2/validations/accounts \
  --header 'x-client-id: CLIENTID' \
  --header 'x-program-id: VERIAUTH' \
  --data '[{"requestId":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000","account":{"accountNumber":"12345","financialInstitutionId":{"clearingSystemId":{"id":"122199983","idType":"ABA"}}},"entity":{"individual":{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Abbot","fullName":"Jane Abbot"}}}]'
```

#### Entity Validation

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-mock.payments.jpmorgan.com/tsapi/v2/validations/entities \
  --header 'x-client-id: CLIENTID' \
  --header 'x-program-id: COMPANYINDIVIDUAL' \
  --data '[{"requestId":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174123","entity":{"individual":{"firstName":"JOHN","lastName":"SMITH","fullName":"MR JOHN KAY SMITH MARTINEZ JR","postalAddress":{"addressLine":["123 MAIN ST","APT 1A"],"townName":"TAMPA","countrySubDvsn":"FL","country":"US","postalCode":"33607"}}}}]'
```

#### Payroll Validation

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-mock.payments.jpmorgan.com/tsapi/v2/validations/accounts \
  --header 'x-client-id: CLIENTID' \
  --header 'x-program-id: VERIAUTH' \
  --data '[{"requestId":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174124","account":{"accountNumber":"12345","financialInstitutionId":{"clearingSystemId":{"id":"122199983","idType":"ABA"}}},"entity":{"individual":{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Abbot","fullName":"Jane Abbot"}},"transactions":[{"context":"PAYROLL","amount":{"amount":2500.00,"currency":"USD"}}]}]'
```
