# Testing Instructions for Node.js and SonarLint Setup

## 1. Verify Node.js Installation

1. Open a terminal in your project directory.
2. Run the test script to check Node.js version:

```bash
node test-node-version.js
```

3. Expected output:

```
Node.js version test script
Node.js version: vXX.XX.XX
```

If you see the version number, Node.js is installed correctly.

## 2. Verify SonarLint Functionality in VSCode

1. Open VSCode.
2. Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file in your project.
3. Check the "Problems" panel for SonarLint warnings or errors.
4. Open the "Output" panel and select "SonarLint" from the dropdown to see logs.
5. If SonarLint is working, you should see analysis results and no errors related to Node.js.

## 3. Troubleshooting

- If `node` command is not recognized, ensure Node.js is installed and added to your system PATH.
- Restart VSCode after installing Node.js.
- Verify the `sonarlint.pathToNodeExecutable` setting in `.vscode/settings.json` points to the correct Node.js executable path.

## 4. Additional Notes

- You can modify `.vscode/settings.json` to update the Node.js path if installed in a custom location.
- For any issues, consult the SonarLint extension documentation or Node.js installation guide.
